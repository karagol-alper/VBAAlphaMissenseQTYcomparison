# AlphaMissense QTY Comparison VBA Codes

Overview

This repository contains VBA codes designed to automate the process of comparing QTY changes in protein sequences based on AlphaMissense results. The scripts generate Excel spreadsheets that facilitate the analysis of polar and hydrophilic QTY variations, providing an efficient way to assess these changes across multiple sequences.

Files

AlphaMissensehydrophilic-QTY.bas:
This VBA script processes AlphaMissense results, focusing on hydrophilic QTY changes. It extracts relevant data, organizes it into a structured format, and generates a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet, that compares QTY changes across the input data, organizing the results into easily interpretable tables and charts.

AlphaMissensepolar-QTY.bas:
Similar to the above script, this VBA code is tailored for analyzing polar QTY changes. It processes the AlphaMissense data and outputs a detailed Excel spreadsheet that highlights the differences and patterns in QTY substitutions.


Load the VBA Code:

1) Open Excel.
2) Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor.
3) Import the .bas files by navigating to File > Import File... and selecting AlphaMissensehydrophilic-QTY.bas and AlphaMissensepolar-QTY.bas.
   
NOTES: Ensure that your AlphaMissense results are in the correct format before running the scripts.
The scripts are optimized for large datasets but may require adjustments based on specific analysis needs.
